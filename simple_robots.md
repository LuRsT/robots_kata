## About the robots

A robot position is represented by a pair of co-ordinates and the robotâ€™s current bearing.
An example position might be (1, 3, South) which means that the robot is 1 mile east and three miles north and is facing south.

The co-ordinate of the position one place North from (0,0) is (0, 1).

## Controlling the ROBOT

The robot is only able to move forward or turn on it's axis (changing the bearing), without changing position.

## Your Code

You should be able to have an object which represents the robot, it's location and position, and also methods, allowing it to change the position according to the rules above.
